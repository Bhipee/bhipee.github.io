[🌇](echo/) Hi there👋🏻, I am Zheng Liu, a research assistant at [PolyU](https://polyu.edu.hk)<img src='./images/polyu.png' style='width: 1.5em;'> and [InfiX.ai](https://huggingface.co/InfiX-ai)<img src='./images/infix.webp' style='width: 1.5em;'>. Currently, I am supervised by Prof. [Hongxia Yang](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~hongxyang/) with a group of talented peers, working on developing GenAI that everyone can access.
I am now leading an effort on MLLM, MoE, Transfer Learning, Gaze Estimation and Hand Pose Estimation. If you are seeking any form of **academic cooperation**, please feel free to email me at [liu_zheng[at]buaa.edu.cn](liu_zheng[at]buaa.edu.cn).

I got my M.Eng degree from Beihang University, advised by Prof. [Feng Lu](http://shi.buaa.edu.cn/lufeng/en/index.htm). Previously, I received my B.Eng degree in Computer Science from Xidian University in 2022.

<!-- **My research** include the intersection of machine learning, deep learning, pattern recognition, and statistical modeling/inference with applications for computer vision, computational photography, low-level vision, human-computer interaction, and AR/MR.  -->

<!-- **My research** aims to build multimodal, highly expressive, lifelike, and immersive interactive agents, covering perception, understanding, reconstruction, and generation of *humans and the world*. *Specifically*:
